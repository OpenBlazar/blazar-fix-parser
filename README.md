# Introduction

Main goal of this project was to get familiar with different technologies than I already had opportunity to learn. I chose FIX parser because FIX itself is something I've already worked with, it is fairly simple topic and I wanted to create project at least little useful for someone. Web application is used in one company that use FIX daily in their software. Making money is not purpose of this site, but there is PayPal subscription added to help covering server expenses. If you would like to develop Blazar FIX Parser then pull requests are welcomed. 

# Stack

Technology stack may feel odd for more experience developers, but as I said choice was made to choose more uncommon technologies.
